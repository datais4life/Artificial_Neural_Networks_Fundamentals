# Artificial_Neural_Network_Fundamentals

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks which cover the fundamentals of using PyTorch to build and manipulate ANNs. PyTorch is a framework that deep learning models can be built on for applications such as image recognition and language processing. Topics include:

- Auto Graident
- Batch Normalization
- Batch Sizing
- Custom Loss Functions
- Image Classification
- Image Translation
- Learning Rate
- Loss Optimizers
- Tensor Operations
- Saving Load Models
- Inspecting Images
